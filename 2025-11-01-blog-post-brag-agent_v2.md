# Building a Brag Document AI Agent with Claude Code

On October 26, 2025, I published a 1,954-word technical how-to post on my personal website (michaelmarcal.com) after a two-year writing hiatus. The post demonstrates building an AI agent for drafting brag document entries using Claude Code and represents a dual achievement: I first built the functional agent in under an hour (comprising just 62 lines of markdown files), then spent several hours documenting the development process. The post serves as both proof of concept for rapid AI agent development and a practical guide for others looking to leverage Claude Code for personal productivity tools.

The publication re-establishes my technical writing presence and showcases practical applications of AI agents for knowledge work. Since publication, the post has garnered 16 pageviews and produced a tool I continue to use for tracking professional accomplishments. What makes this accomplishment particularly notable is the efficiency of the development process—building a functional, reusable AI agent in less than an hour with minimal code demonstrates both the power of modern AI development tools and my ability to quickly prototype solutions that bridge professional AI expertise with personal productivity needs. The post creates a valuable technical resource for the developer community while simultaneously serving as documentation for a tool that enhances my own workflow going forward.
