Brag Document Input - November 1, 2025

1. Accomplishment:
This week, I wrote a new blog post for my website, https://michaelmarcal.com/building-a-brag-document-ai-agent-with-claude-code/. It was the first in a while after a couple years hiatus. It is an explanation and a how-to style post which describes how I built an agent to draft brag document entries. In order to write it, I also needed to build the agent using Claude Code before I could explain how. Thus, it is a two-fold achievement.

2. Life Area:
This affects my personal, side-project and website. Given I work professionally in the space, it does have crossover benefits.

3. Outcomes:
The post is roughly 2,000 words. It was proof that I could generate an agent using Claude Code relatively easily.
