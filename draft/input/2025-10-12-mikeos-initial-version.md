# Brag Document Input - October 12, 2025

## Accomplishment
I've developed an initial version of a mikeOS using Claude code which is a personal AI assistant agent aimed at automating repetitive aspects of my life. Initially this includes a daily news briefing, and a journaling system.

## Area of Impact
This is a personal project that I'm doing on the side to acquaint myself with Claude code, AI agents, and hoping to document more publicly.

## Outcomes
In the first week of operation, I've created 9 journal entries to end the day and 8 daily briefings to start the day. Additionally, this has sparked the idea of doing something similar on my work computer for my work life admin tasks.
