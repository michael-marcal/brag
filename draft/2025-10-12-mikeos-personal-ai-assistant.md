# mikeOS: Personal AI Assistant Agent

## Summary

I developed the initial version of mikeOS, a personal AI assistant agent built using Claude Code, designed to automate repetitive aspects of my daily life. This project serves dual purposes: as a practical tool for personal productivity and as a hands-on learning experience with Claude Code and AI agent development. The system currently includes two core features: an automated daily news briefing to start each day with relevant information, and a journaling system to facilitate end-of-day reflection and documentation.

In its first week of operation, mikeOS demonstrated consistent engagement and utility, generating 9 journal entries for evening reflections and 8 daily briefings for morning routines. This represents near-daily usage across both features, validating the initial concept and establishing sustainable automation patterns. Beyond the immediate productivity gains, this project has successfully achieved its secondary goal of deepening my understanding of AI agent architectures and Claude Code capabilities. The positive early results have already inspired plans to extend similar automation approaches to my work computer, where I aim to develop analogous tools for managing work-life administrative tasks, potentially multiplying the impact of this initial investment in learning and development.
