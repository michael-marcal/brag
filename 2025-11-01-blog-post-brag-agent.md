# Building a Brag Document AI Agent with Claude Code

After a two-year hiatus from blogging, I published a comprehensive technical how-to post on my personal website (michaelmarcal.com) that demonstrates building an AI agent for drafting brag document entries using Claude Code. This accomplishment was particularly notable because it required me to first build the functional agent before I could document the process—turning a single blog post into a dual achievement of both software development and technical writing. The post serves as both proof of concept for rapid AI agent development and a practical guide for others looking to leverage Claude Code for personal productivity tools.

The post spans approximately 2,000 words and provides detailed, step-by-step guidance on agent development, breaking my extended writing drought with substantial technical content. Beyond demonstrating my ability to build functional AI tooling relatively easily using Claude Code, this achievement bridges my professional expertise in AI with my personal brand and side projects. The publication re-establishes my technical writing presence, creates a valuable resource for the developer community, and showcases practical applications of AI agents for knowledge work—all while producing a tool I can continue to use for tracking my own professional accomplishments going forward.
